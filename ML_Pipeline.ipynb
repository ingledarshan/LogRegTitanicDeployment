        "### Problem Statement: Titanic Survival Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Context\n",
        "In 1912, the RMS Titanic, a luxury British steamship, sank after hitting an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 perished, making it one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history. The disaster has since become a pivotal case study in safety, regulations, and human factors. In this context, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Business Objective\n",
        "The primary goal is to create a machine learning pipeline that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on the available data. The insights derived from this model can help in understanding the factors that influenced survival rates and can be applied to improve safety measures in modern maritime and other transportation industries.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Scope and Deliverables\n",
        "1. **Data Understanding and Exploration**:\n",
        "   - Explore the dataset to understand the distribution and relationship of features.\n",
        "   - Identify and handle missing values.\n",
        "   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing**:\n",
        "   - Clean the data by handling missing values and removing irrelevant features.\n",
        "   - Transform categorical features into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.\n",
        "   - Scale numerical features to ensure consistency across data inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - Train multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers.\n",
        "   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
        "   - Compare model performance and select the best model based on evaluation metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Machine Learning Pipeline**:\n",
        "   - Develop a robust machine learning pipeline that integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.\n",
        "   - Ensure that the pipeline is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.\n",
        "   - Provide detailed documentation of each step within the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Detailed Steps and Justification\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Collection**:\n",
        "   - Load the Titanic dataset from a reliable source (e.g., seaborn library) to ensure data consistency and accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Understanding and Exploration**:\n",
        "   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform initial data analysis to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the data. This helps in identifying important features and potential challenges like missing values and data imbalance.\n",
        "   - **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values can lead to inaccurate model predictions. We will impute missing values for numerical features using mean/median values and for categorical features using the most frequent values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
        "   - **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**: Columns such as 'deck', 'embark_town', 'alive', 'class', 'who', 'adult_male', and 'alone' do not contribute significantly to the prediction task and will be removed to simplify the dataset.\n",
        "   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert categorical features such as 'sex' and 'embarked' into numerical format using one-hot encoding. This ensures that the machine learning algorithms can process these features effectively.\n",
        "   - **Scaling Numerical Features**: Scale features like 'age' and 'fare' to standardize the data. This step is crucial for models that rely on distance calculations, like KNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective linear model that provides a probabilistic approach to binary classification problems.\n",
        "   - **Decision Tree**: A non-linear model that splits data based on feature values, providing an intuitive understanding of feature importance and decision-making process.\n",
        "   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A distance-based algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity to other points in the dataset.\n",
        "   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of model effectiveness, especially in dealing with imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Machine Learning Pipeline**:\n",
        "   - **ColumnTransformer**: Combine preprocessing steps for numerical and categorical features into a single transformer. This ensures that all preprocessing steps are applied consistently.\n",
        "   - **Pipeline Integration**: Create a pipeline that includes both the preprocessing steps and the machine learning model. This modular approach simplifies model training, testing, and maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Ask\n",
        "Create a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. The pipeline should include data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers. Provide detailed documentation of each step, including the justification for chosen techniques and models. The final deliverable should be a modular, scalable, and maintainable pipeline that can be used for further analysis and model refinement.\n",
        "\n",
        "By building this pipeline, we aim to derive valuable insights into the factors affecting survival rates and apply these learnings to improve safety protocols in modern transportation systems."

        "\n",
        "1. **Automation**: A pipeline automates the repetitive tasks involved in the machine learning process, like data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. This saves time and reduces the chances of human error.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Consistency**: By using a pipeline, the same steps are applied every time you run the process. This ensures that your results are consistent and reliable.\n",

        "4. **Reproducibility**: Pipelines make it easy to reproduce results. If someone else needs to replicate your work, they can use the same pipeline to achieve the same outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Modularity**: Pipelines break down the machine learning process into smaller, manageable parts (modules). Each part can be developed, tested, and improved independently, making the whole system more flexible and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Scalability**: Pipelines can handle large datasets and complex processes more effectively. As your data grows or your model becomes more sophisticated, the pipeline can scale to meet these needs without a complete overhaul.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Ease of Experimentation**: With a pipeline, you can easily tweak different parts of the process to see how changes affect the outcome. This makes experimenting with different models and techniques simpler and faster."
